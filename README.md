# Learning Swift
To achieve some of the side projects I want to build this year, I'll need to learn Swift. I've also had an interest in learning how to build interfaces with SwiftUI, as it seems pretty delightful to use from Twitter. Watch me learn in public!

## What's here
The projects from [Apple's SwiftUI Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) that I'll be modifying as I learn and try to branch out on my own.
